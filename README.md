contact book project allows users to store, manage, and retrieve contact information. The core functionality typically includes adding new contacts, searching for existing contacts, updating contact details, deleting contacts, and potentially exporting/importing contact data. A menu-driven interface is common, offering options for these actions. 
1. Data Storage:
2. Dictionaries:A dictionary can be used to store contacts, where the key is the contact's name (or another unique identifier) and the value is a nested dictionary containing details like phone number, email, etc. 
Classes:
A class can be created to represent a contact, with attributes for name, phone number, email, etc. This approach promotes better organization and encapsulation. 
Databases:
For larger contact lists or persistent storage, databases like SQLite can be used to store and retrieve contact information. 
3. Core Functionality:
Adding Contacts: Prompt the user for contact details (name, phone, email, etc.) and store them using the chosen data structure. 
Searching Contacts: Allow the user to search for a contact by name or other criteria and display the corresponding information. 
Updating Contacts: Provide functionality to modify existing contact details. 
Deleting Contacts: Enable the user to remove a contact from the list. 
Displaying Contacts: Offer options to view all contacts or a specific subset. 
Menu-Driven Interface: A loop that presents the user with a menu of options (add, search, update, delete, view, exit) and executes the corresponding actions based on user input.
